    <h1 id="screamer">The early life and Heroic acts to the people of land:</h1>

    <p>
      Dedan Kimathi was from Karunaini village. Born on 31st October, 1920.<br>
      Dedan was a drifter,a restless romantic, an idealistic plotter.<br> But he had a hard edge to him.
      One that the Colonialists and their African stooges knew and feared.
      <br>
    
  <h2>The forest and Struggle</h2>
      Dedan Kimathi had, as KAU’s Organising Secretary for Thomson Falls, been involved in recruitment of members <br>
      to this precursor of KANU.

      He also belonged to a hardcore, young and militant faction of KAU, called Aanake a Forty.<br>
      This comprised of young men who belonged to the 40 riika(age group),<br>
      most of whom had fought on the Allied side in WW2 and were ready to take up arms<br>
      in the struggle for Kenya’s independence.
  
  <h2>1953-1956</h2>
      In the Aberdares,the war was increasingly becoming a man hunt for 1 man:Field Marshal Dedan Kimathi Waciuri.<br>
      As the introduction of air power by the British Government tilted the balance of the struggle to the favor of<br>
      the settlers.<br>
      Then came the capture of General China Itote in 1954, the death in action of General Kago Mboko.<br>
      By 1955, thousands of freedom fighters had surrendered in the amnesty offered by the settler government<br>
      and these gave a lot of intelligence to the colonial forces.<br>

  <h2>Capture and Death</h2>
  Kimathi was a crafty operator. He changed tact and blended with his surroundings like the predator he was,<br>
  He had a network of spies and supporters in the villages and colonial forces who kept him abreast.<br>
  He even had the audacity to write and post letters to newspapers and on ocassion,to the Nyeri D,C and<br>
  the colonial Governor; until that fateful day in October, 1956.<br>
  Coming from Chief Muhoya’s home at around 8pm, the Field Marshal was accompanied by his brother,<br>
  Wambararia, his aide, Kirihinya Ndegwa and an unidentified woman.<br>
  They had finished yet another of their dangerous forays to the villages, to gather food and <br>
  intelligence from supporters.<br>
  <br>
  A home guard, Ndirangu, who knew of his whereabouts, ambushed them in a sugarcane grove and shot Kimathi in the leg.<br>
  Suddenly beset with remorse, he urged them to run but Kimathi refused, knowing he could not make it very far.<br>
  He decided to buy time for his entourage to make it to the forest.<br>

Kimathi was arrested and taken to Nyeri General Hospital chained under heavy guard.<br>
It was from his hospital bed that a death sentence was passed on him.Stoic and defiant to the end,<br>
the gallant son of Tetu refused to grovel or plead for his life.<br>

He was eventually transferred to Kamiti Prison for his date with the hangman.<br>

The Field Marshall was sent to the gallows at dawn on 18th February,<em>1957</em>.<br>
The mist hung in the air as the trap door opened undet the weight of this gallant man who had taken the fate<br>
of an entire nation upon his lean shoulders.<br>

Perhaps Kimathi never saw the ironic significance that the month of October held upon his life;Born on 31st October,1920.<br>
Started the armed struggle on 20th October,1952.Captured 21st October,1956.
